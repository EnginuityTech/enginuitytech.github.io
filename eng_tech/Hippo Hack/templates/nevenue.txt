Hackathon Venue Inquiry
Hi $0$!

My name is Michael, and I am a founder of Enginuity Tech, and we are a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization pursuing education in computer science. Hippo Hack, one of the largest hackathons in New England, will be hosted in Massachusetts in July, welcoming students in grades 6-12 with free admission! Hippo Hack is a hackathon dedicated to our participants and their future. It would be a dream of ours if we could hold our hackathon at Northeastern at $2$!

Lately, the tech industry has skyrocketed in development. The education in pre-secondary schools, however, for the vast field of tech and tech-related fields, such as computer science, information technology, data science, and so on, is very limited and low-level despite its growing prevalence in our lives today.

We at Enginuity are aiming to alter the trajectory of these issues, one method of which is running Hippo Hack! Students will work in groups and employ their creativity to create a one-of-a-kind project with a basis of having a positive impact on society. Hippo Hack is assisting the next generation of not only programmers, but entrepreneurs, innovators, and leaders. Hippo Hack adds an opportunity for students to enlarge their skills, show off their talents, and meet some new people along the way, helping foster this new and prosperous generation in tech!

Your help would be greatly appreciated and it will contribute to the education of a new generation in one of today’s most prevalent fields of study. If you are interested, let’s have a quick chat! Feel free to contact me via email so we can schedule a quick 15 minute meeting or phone call so we can talk about my goals for Hippo Hack and more about our possible plans. For additional details regarding sponsorship, see the attached prospectus. Additionally, you can find our website at hippohack.org!

Sincerely,
Michael Zhang
