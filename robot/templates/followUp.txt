Follow up for Sponsorship Opportunity
Hi $0$,

Just a follow up email regarding whether you guys would still like to be involved in a sponsorship/venue opportunity for our computing event, Hippo Hack. We now are pushing back our event to July 1st, so please let me know whether you guys would still be interested in helping us! We are still excited to work with you guys! Refer to the attached prospectus for more details.

Thanks,
Michael Zhang
