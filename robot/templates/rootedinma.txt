Volunteer Assistance Opportunity
Dear $0$,

We are Michael and Eric from Rooted in Mass, a nonprofit organization dedicated to giving back to our planet through volunteer work! We are rising high school seniors at Acton-Boxborough Regional High School, and we have both volunteered many hours throughout my high school years at the Acton Arboretum.

We are concerned about the catastrophic threats to Earth’s natural resources and wildlife due to climate change, and so to take action, we are creating a volunteer resource for students who want to get involved in initiatives that steward the land and support our natural resources. Among several such volunteer opportunities, we would like to promote volunteering on $2$’s land conservation trails to assist you in your work stewarding the land and trails for the benefit of wildlife and people. We are working with Bettina Abe in the Acton Conservation Division, who will assist us in signing out the tools volunteers will need!

Please send us an email and let us know some tasks you would like volunteer assistance with! For instance:<ul><li>Cutting back, digging out invasive shrubs, pulling garlic mustard, or chopping down knotweed</li><li>Pruning trails during the busy growing season to keep trails wide enough for hikers to pass</li><li>Picking up trash</li><li>An area and specific invasive plant you’d like us to work on removing?<ul><li>Please describe the location and invasive plant you want to focus on and list instructions if so.</li></ul></li></ul>Also, let us know how often you would like these services!

Any other suggestions you might have that would enable young people to make a difference through volunteer conservation work would also be very appreciated :)

Sincerely,
Michael Zhang and Eric Cai
