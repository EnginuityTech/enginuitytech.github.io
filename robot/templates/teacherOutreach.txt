Hackathon opportunity and free STEM courses for your students!
Hi $0$,

My name is Michael and I am a junior at the Acton-Boxborough Regional High School. I am a founder of Enginuity Tech, a nonprofit organization that offers students free STEM classes and organizes local hackathons in the Massachusetts area for all students of any programming expertise. This year we are hosting Hippo Hack, a free, in-person hackathon hosted here in Massachusetts for all students in grades 6-12 with an interest in the field of computer science. Would it be possible to pass along the following message along with the flyer to the clubs you manage at your school as well as your students via email or in-person?

Create a team with your friends to join in on a day full of hacking and compete over the course of 14 hours for prizes! Hippo Hack is a completely free, in-person hackathon happening on July 1st hosted here in Massachusetts for all students in grades 6-12 who want to show their creativity and learn more in computer science. Also, with the summer coming up, their summer classes are also starting soon! Enginuity Tech is dedicated to offering students better education in fields of STEM and computer science. They offer free, engaging classes taught by qualified students who have excelled in the subjects they teach. Visit bit.ly/enginuitytech for more information about classes and hippohack.org for information about Hippo Hack! Additionally, you can follow them on Instagram @enginuitytech!

Thanks so much for your help!
