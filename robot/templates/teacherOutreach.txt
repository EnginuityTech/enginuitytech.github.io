Upcoming hackathon opportunity for your students!
Hi $0$,

My name is Michael and I am a rising senior at ABRHS. I am running a hackathon in a few weeks in the Greater Boston area, and I am wondering if you or any student leaders could help me forward the following message and attached flyer about my hackathon to your $2$!

Create a team with your friends to join in on a day full of hacking and compete over the course of 12 hours for a 400 dollar prize pool! Hippo Hack is a free, in-person hackathon hosted at the Reuben Hoar Public Library in Littleton, Massachusetts for all students in grades 6-12 who have interest in computer science and want to show their creativity and learn more in computer science. Free concessions and meals will be given out! If you are interested in participating, please check out https://hippohack.org

Thanks so much for your help!
Michael
